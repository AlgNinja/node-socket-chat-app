### **Objective**
Creating the best, most secure chat app I can using only Socket.io, Express, and Node.js. This project is meant to practice my skills in Backend Development, Specifically Sockets

### **TODO's**
-**Add Authentication**

-**Set up on a server**

-**Add a feature to save chats**

-**Add a feature for private chats**

-**Clean up the UI**

### **Note:**

The initial boilerplate for this was heavily based off https://socket.io/get-started/chat but I am making many changes on it to make it my own project
